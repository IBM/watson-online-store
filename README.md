# Creating a Retail Chatbot using Watson Conversation, Discovery and Database Services

In this developer journey we will create a Watson Conversation based chatbot
that allows a user to: 1) find items to purchase using Watson Discovery, and
2) add and remove items from their cart by updating a Cloudant NoSQL Database.

When the reader has completed this journey, they will understand how to:

* Create a chatbot dialog with Watson Conversation
* Dynamically store and update a Cloudant NoSQL database based on chatbot results
* Seed data into Watson Discovery and leverage its natural language capabilities
* Manage and customize a Slack group to add a chatbot

## Included Components
- Bluemix Watson Conversation
- Bluemix Watson Discovery
- Bluemix Cloudant NoSQL DB
- Slack
- Python

# Steps

**NOTE:** Perform steps 1-6 **OR** click the ``Deploy to Bluemix`` button and hit ``Create`` and then jump to step 5.

> There is no web UI (only Slack), so don't use the ``View app`` button to see the app. Use the Bluemix dashboard to find and manage the app. Use your Slack UI to chat.


[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://deployment-tracker.mybluemix.net/stats/5fd641e32af04e4adb16f26c46de3587/button.svg)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM/watson-online-store&cm_mmc=github-code-_-native-_-retailchatbot-_-deploy2bluemix)

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Create Bluemix services](#2-create-bluemix-services)
3. [Configure Watson Conversation](#3-configure-watson-conversation)
4. [Configure Watson Discovery](#4-configure-watson-discovery)
5. [Configure Slack](#5-configure-slack)
6. [Run the application](#6-run-the-application)

## 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `watson-online-store` locally. In a terminal, run:

  `$ git clone https://github.com/ibm/watson-online-store`

We’ll be using the file [`data/workspace.json`](data/workspace.json) and the folder
[`data/ibm_store_html/`](data/ibm_store_html)

## 2. Create Bluemix services

Create the following services:

  * [**Watson Conversation**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/conversation)
  * [**Watson Discovery**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/discovery)
  * [**Cloudant NoSQL DB**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db/)

## 3. Configure Watson Conversation

Launch the **Watson Conversation** tool. Use the **import** icon button on the right

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="55" src="doc/source/images/import_conversation_workspace.png">
</p>

Find the local version of [`data/workspace.json`](data/workspace.json) and select
**Import**. Find the **Workspace ID** by clicking on the context menu of the new
workspace and select **View details**. Save this ID for later.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="250" src="doc/source/images/open_conversation_menu.png">
</p>

*Optionally*, to view the conversation dialog select the workspace and choose the
**Dialog** tab, here's a snippet of the dialog:

![](doc/source/images/dialog.png)

## 4. Configure Watson Discovery

Launch the **Watson Discovery** tool. Create a **new data collection** and give the data
collection a unique name.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="300" src="doc/source/images/name_discovery.png">
</p>

Seed the content by selecting **Add data to this collection** in the dialog,
choose the HTML files under [`data/ibm_store_html/`](data/ibm_store_html). When
completed, save the **environment_id** and **collection_id**.

<p align="center">
  <img width="800" height="225" src="doc/source/images/view_discovery_ids.png">
</p>

## 5. Configure Slack

[Create a slack group](https://slack.com/create) or use an existing one if you
have sufficient authorization. (Refer to [Slack's how-to](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/206845317-Create-a-Slack-team)
on creating new groups.) To add a new bot, go to the Slack group’s application settings
by navigating to `https://<slack_group>.slack.com/apps/manage` and selecting the
**Custom Integrations** menu on the left.

![](doc/source/images/manage_slack_settings.png)

Give the bot a fun name. Once created save the **API Token** that is generated
![](doc/source/images/view_bot_token.png)

Run `/invite <botame>` in a channel to invite the bot, or message it directly.

  <img width="400" height="125" src="doc/source/images/invite_bot.png">
</p>

## 6. Run the application

### If you used the Deploy to Bluemix button...

If you used ``Deploy to Bluemix``, most of the setup is automatic, but not
quite all of it. We have to update a few environment variables.

In the Bluemix dashboard find the App that was created. Click on ``Runtime`` on the menu and navigate to the ``Environment variables`` tab.

![](doc/source/images/env_vars.png)

Update the three environment variables:

  * Set ``SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`` to the token you saved in Step 5
  * Set ``SLACK_BOT_USER`` to the name of your bot
  * It's probably OK to leave ``CLOUDANT_DB_NAME`` set to ``watson-online-store``

Save the new values and restart the application, watch the logs for errors.

### If you decided to run the app locally...

Copy the [`env.sample`](env.sample) to `.env`, edit it with the necessary IDs
and run the application.

The `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, and `URL` settings for each service can be obtained
from the `Service Credentials` tab in BlueMix. The other settings were collected
during the earlier setup steps.

```
$ cp env.sample .env
### edit .env
$ python run.py
```

# Sample output

Start a conversation with your bot:

![](doc/source/images/convo_init.png)

Add an item to your cart:

![](doc/source/images/convo_add.png)

# Troubleshooting

* Help! I'm seeing errors in my log

This is expected during the first run. The app tries to start before the Discovery
service is fully created. Allow a minute or two to pass, the following message
should appear:

``Watson Online Store bot is connected and running!``

* Setting environment variables for a local run

> NOTE: This only needs to be set if the application is running locally.

The credentials for Bluemix services (Conversation, Cloudant, and Discovery), can
be found in the ``Services`` menu in Bluemix, and selecting the ``Service Credentials``
option.

```

# Privacy Notice

If using the Deploy to Bluemix button some metrics are tracked, the following
information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/cf-deployment-tracker-service) service
on each deployment:

* Python package version
* Python repository URL
* Application Name (application_name)
* Application GUID (application_id)
* Application instance index number (instance_index)
* Space ID (space_id)
* Application Version (application_version)
* Application URIs (application_uris)
* Labels of bound services
* Number of instances for each bound service and associated plan information

This data is collected from the setup.py file in the sample application and the ``VCAP_APPLICATION``
and ``VCAP_SERVICES`` environment variables in IBM Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This
data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Bluemix to
measure the usefulness of our examples, so that we can continuously improve the content we offer
to you. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker
service will be tracked.

## Disabling Deployment Tracking

To disable tracking, simply remove ``cf_deployment_tracker.track()`` from the
``run.py`` file in the top level directory.
